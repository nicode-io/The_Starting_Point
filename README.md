# BECODDE BOOTCAMP :mortar_board:
> 10 months to change your life and become a developer

### **BeCode** Intensive Bootcamp
In seven months you have a wonderful luck to become a great web developer. Inclusion and share spirit is your daily feeling !   
The bootcamp aims at acquiring self-learning skills and mastering the basics, both on the frontend and backend sides. An accompaniment is provided by a team of great coaches who will guide you and help you overcome the various peaks of difficulty encountered.  
Partly remote at the moment due to the health situation but we have turned this into an opportunity by using a maximum of collaborative tools. The two programming languages I chose are Javascript and Python. At the end of the bootcamp I will certainly be able to help you on your projects while continuing to improve my skills on a daily basis. Passion guides me at every moment, in every learning curve and surpassing oneself is part of my DNA.   
Give maximum to get maximum :rocket:

### Collaboration
Hello, I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), welcome to my all new life as developer.
After 15 years as manager and sales director it's time for me to make my dreams come true and to become a developer.
Autonomous learner, problem solver and commited team member, I'm ready for challenges !
So feel strongly to give me any recommandation about my work, advice for future projects, and all comments you want.  
If you are looking to hire a strong hybrid and atypical profile in your team do not hesitate to contact me to check if we can share a project together !  
Thanks by advance for that :heart:
