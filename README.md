### COLLABORATION

Hello, I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), a computer science enthusiast who is in the middle of his reconversion as a developer. After 15 years in the commercial sector as a manager and director, I decided to put this career on hold to devote myself fully to development.  
After an intensive 7 month bootcamp at Becode where I was able to acquire the superpowers of a junior developer, I am now doing a 3-months internship with the awesome team of [ØPP](http://opp.mx).
[ØPP](http://opp.mx) is a publisher of digital solutions (websites, applications, connected objects...) specialised in engagement techniques and gaming.
I'm lucky that my first professional experience as a developer takes place in this framework which suits me so well. !
Positive spirit, with an unquenchable thirst for learning, committed and structured, I like to take up challenges and always progress by giving the best of myself. 
If you have a project, no matter how big or small, don't hesitate to share it, we always have to win by doing things alongside others.  

See you soon!
