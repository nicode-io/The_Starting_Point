### Description
> Start 23-12-2020

This project aims to make hooks a new superpower.
Using functions and hooks in React is a great way to clean, reusable and wel-organized code.
I'll learn more about states, context, and other "classics" but also about new suspense and concurrent mode.
Another focus will be to create custom hooks and find the best community's one too.

### COLLABORATION

Hello, I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), a computer science enthusiast who is in the middle of his reconversion as a developer. After 15 years in the commercial sector as a manager and director, I decided to put this career on hold to devote myself fully to development.  
After an intensive 7-months full-time bootcamp at Becode, where I was able to acquire the superpowers of a junior developer, I am now constantly exploring the challenges that the various companies and associations active in the field can offer me.  
Positive spirit, with an unquenchable thirst for learning, committed and structured, I like to take up challenges and always progress by giving the best of myself.
If you have a project, no matter how big or small, don't hesitate to share it, we always have to win by doing things alongside others.

See you soon!
