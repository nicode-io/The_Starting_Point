### Personnal projects : 
In life, you have to start somewhere, otherwise you'll never get anywhere. [You will find here the beginning of a portfolio](https://wwww.nicode.be), it'a fresh-start/side-project, I will upgrade it in a few weeks.

Here is [a Tetris game](https://www.nicode.be/lightris) made thanks to [Freecodecamp.org](https:www.freecodecamp.org). I brought a minimalist design, the superfluous is more than often useless.

### Collaboration & feedback : 
  I, [Nicolas](https://github.com/nicode-be), am at a start of a new career, it's a big change but it's so exciting !  
  So feel strongly to give me any recommandation about my work, advice for future projects, and all comments you want.  
  Thanks by advance for that :heart:
