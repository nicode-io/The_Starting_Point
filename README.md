### Description

> Start 10-01-2021

This project aims to study NODEjs and everything related to it: database, REST API, GRAPHQL,
authentication, sessions, cookies, CRUD, MVC, Template engine and many others.
This is done through an e-shop project.

The project is divided in two main projects: 

- 01: ESHOP in MVC: A simple eshop but whith great features like authentication, error handling, ordre and cart management, online payments, ... 
  Backend and frontend are mixed inside Node with the help EJS views rendering HTML code. 
- 02: REST API: A simple feed of posts also with authentication, error handling, security webtoken, ... 
  Node backend is totally splitted from frontend: backend is a REST API, frontend is build with REACT
- 03: GraphQl: Another way to create your API, stop multiply requests and sending too much data with GraphQl but also has downsides

### Achievements
> What I learn with this project

- Application management and routing with Express
- CRUD with MySQL database and Sequelize ORM
- CRUD with MongoDB nosql-database and Mongoose ODM
- Work with nested objects and refs with MongoDB & Mongoose
- Save data on user's computer using cookies and sessions
- Discover how sessions can hide sensitive information and work in link with database
- Explore more deeply the web browser developer tools
- Use sessions and authorizations to hide/show content, menus, buttons, ... to the user
- Use CSRF token, hash user password with Bcrypt
- Sanitize data received by forms and user input, create custom validations
- Understand differences between errors, manage them through a error handling middleware
- Let user upload and download its own files, for example product image 
- Generate dynamic PDF to create invoices for example and allow user to download its own invoices
- Manage pagination: previous, next, first, last page
- Use js script in EJS views to send async requests and manipulate DOM
- Use Stripe to manage payments in an eshop, configure checkout process entirely (need webhook for prod)
- Understand how REST API works: rules, request format, authentication with tokens, routing, and many more
- Work with websockets to send data to user without them to request them, broadcast all over your project
- Optimize your API with GraphQl, helps you get shaped and light request with only the data you want into them
