    A second year of coding and learning to get off to a great start. After a second bootcamp started in C# and BI, it's time to get down to business with a first experience in a Belgian electronics company. First project: the creation of an application for managing home automation installations from A to Z. 
   Learning remains my daily life. Doing my best and always better is my motto for this second year ! 
                 </p>
                 Thanks to all those who help me every day to live in the passion of coding. ðŸš€ ðŸ–¤ðŸ’›ðŸ’–
