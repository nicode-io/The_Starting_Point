### COLLABORATION

Hello, I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), a computer science enthusiast who is in the middle of his reconversion as a developer. 

After 15 years in the commercial sector as a manager and director, I decided to put this career on hold to devote myself fully to development.  

Positive spirit, with an unquenchable thirst for learning, committed and structured, I like to take up challenges and always progress by giving the best of myself. 
If you have a project, no matter how big or small, don't hesitate to share it, we always have to win by doing things alongside others.  

After an intensive 7 month bootcamp at Becode where I was able to acquire the superpowers of a junior developer and an internship with the awesome team of [ØPP](http://opp.mx).
[ØPP](http://opp.mx) is a publisher of digital solutions (websites, applications, connected objects...) specialised in engagement techniques and gaming.

Now I am back on my study bench and I take advantage of each day that passes to refine, complete and increase my knowledge in order to find my next work team.

See you soon ! :heart:
