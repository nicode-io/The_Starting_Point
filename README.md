<h3 align="center">A Medior Way</h3>

<p align="center">
    A second year of coding and learning to get off to a great start. After a second bootcamp started in C# and BI, it's time to get down to business with a first experience in a Belgian electronics company. On the agenda was the creation of a React Native application to manage electronic modules.

Learning remains my daily life, with currently three main side-learning: Python, Flutter and Algorithms. Doing my best and always better is my motto for this second year!

<br />
Thanks to all those who help me every day to achieve my goals in the passion of development.
