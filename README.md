### Description

This repository contains the three parts of our workshop realised during my Becode Bootcamp.  
This workshop aims to initiate people and make them discover this beautiful language who's Python.

---

### Initiation

This part contains basic examples of Python syntax realized through a paper stone cisseaux game.
The game is realized in command line as well as in a more graphical version thanks to a [tkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter).

---

### Django

In this part, we aim to discover the (best) powerfull framework which is Django.   
We started with a small project to understand the MTV models and the ORM power. 

* If you want to start from scratch the project to get a better understanding,
you can visit [THIS REPOSITORY](https://github.com/nicode-io/Workshop_Python_Django/blob/master/README.md)

* This part contains a starting project which includes:
  *   Basic structure 
  *   An app "Event" 
  *   Models 
  *   Views
  *   Forms
  *   Templates

* It also includes .PDF files of the Prezi slideshow, an online and dynamic version of it is available [HERE](https://prezi.com/view/7GGLxCYaLUDdi1pdfKwK).

### AI

In this part, we approach the basics of artificial intelligence through libraries allowing us to respond, to recognise sound and finally, facial recognition.

These libraries are used in the different projects:
* [Speech Recognition](https://www.codinground.com/speech-recognition/)
* [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
