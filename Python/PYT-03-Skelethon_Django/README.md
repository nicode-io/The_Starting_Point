## Collaboration

Hello, I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), a computer science enthusiast who is in the middle of his reconversion as a developer. After 15 years in the commercial sector as a manager and director, I decided to put this career on hold to devote myself fully to development.  
After an intensive 7 month bootcamp at Becode where I was able to acquire the superpowers of a junior developer, I am now constantly exploring the challenges that the various companies and associations active in the field can offer me.  
Positive spirit, with an unquenchable thirst for learning, committed and structured, I like to take up challenges and always progress by giving the best of myself. 
If you have a project, no matter how big or small, don't hesitate to share it, we always have to win by doing things alongside others.  

See you soon!
